This folder is where I stored some lame small projects I started when I first learnt to code &#128514;. All of them are in Python and maybe full of silly codes... \*\*sighhhhhhhh\*\* What a carefree time - listening to Lady Gaga's Born this way, casually reading coding stuffs and periodically discovered interesting stuff. Going to college really does take a toll on us huh... SO many redundant knowledge that we're forced to learn, at least in my country's colleges.

It's so nostalgic, it hits me sometimes.
