# Playground &#9977; &#127796;

This is my playgroundddd!!! Basically I'll do just anything I want in here!!

Some of the thing I might do in here:
* Rebuild, Simulate or Tinkering with some high-level features in programming languages using lower level components.  
  As you might know, there are many features in programming languages (C++, Python, JS) that are actually syntactic sugars, which means these features can actually be built using more primitive ones in the language itself. I often take on the task of simulating these high-level features as a challenge in order to test my understanding of the language and those features themselves. I think it can be attributed to my curiosity as to what's actually happening under the multiple layers of abstraction.
* Some other things??
